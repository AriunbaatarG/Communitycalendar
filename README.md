Community Calendar Web Application
Introduction:
Due to the sheer amount of clubs, emails and events going on, it becomes very hard for someone to know exactly when, where or what clubs they can join or what facilities they can book. Currently, the only way to book is to email the club leader then to get a response to see which times you prefer, then another email if someone has already booked it, then another email to change the time and it is very inefficient. Therefore, I would like to make a community wide web application which allows the user to check the availability, join events and book facilities on campus.

Interface:
-	Calendar of all club events (Campus Crew, Basketball, Volleyball…)
-	List of Available Club Facilities (Music Lab, Dance Room, Lab, Gym…)
-	Contact of Club Leaders and Facility Organizers

Interactions:
-	Club Leaders
-	Input their event (ie. Sunday 02.10.2022, Campus Crew Beginner Class)
-	Sets availability of event (ie. max 20 participants)
-	The event will disappear once the max participants are reached
-	Club leaders can see all the participants names/emails and can remove
-	Send an overall email to all the participants (If they are changing location etc)
-	Contact Information
-	Facilities Organizers
-	Input the Facility (Music Lab, Dance room etc)
-	Set availability of the facility (Music Lab available for booking 8pm - 10pm)
-	Set max amount of time bookable (1 hour sessions)
-	When someone books a time slot, they can APPROVE (confirmation)
-	Sends email to Pforters for key pick up
-	Contact Information
-	Student / Person interested
-	Calendar of all club events and facilities available
-	Ability to sign up for event, or book slot with name and email address
-	Ability to cancel, reschedule or contact Organizers
